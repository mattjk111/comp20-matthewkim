README for COMP 20 Repository:


What is the purpose of this repository:
----------------------------------------
- To hold all of the personal assignments throughout this semester


What was my favorite lab/assignment:
----------------------------------------
- Assignment 3 was my favorite assignment, I enjoyed working with databases and it reminded me of the work I enjoyed in classes like Data Structures

How much do I think I have grown from day 1:
----------------------------------------
- In some ways I haven't grown, due to internal struggle with whether CS is the right field for me. But I do feel more confident working with APIs and understanding more of how the web works.

What was the most important thing I learned:
----------------------------------------
- The most important thing I learned was that it takes a lot of self discipline to do self learning
- This was evident in almost everything we covered in the course, that we were given a taste but overall were responsible for our own learning. This was especially true in Assignment 4, since we had so many directions we could take in completing this assignment.


What topic would I like to delve deeper into:
----------------------------------------
- How to use interfaces/frameworks that are already designed for you to solve more complicated problems.
