Notes:
------
- To be honest, I'm not even sure if I will receive credit for this assignment. It's been a really rough weekend for personal reasons and I just couldn't force myself to work on this. Therefore, I completely understand if I don't get credit for it. However, I don't want Ming to think that I don't care about this or that I don't care about this class, since I see it as really important step towards furthering my career. However, lately, I've also been struggling a lot with imposter syndrome and self-doubt whether computer science is really the field for me, which I think has been reflected in my work. At times I wish that I had and adult to reach out to for these thoughts, but I always feel like it's too late and no mentor wants to work with someone who has a lot of internal struggle. I apologize that this README turned into a depressing reflection, but it was nice to write it out and I don't think anyone is actually going to grade this.
